22, , (I need to write down what I know) 
23, , (I need to read some code...the FamilySearch python SDK would be good) 
24, Done,

26a, Done, (using internal functions)
26b, , (using import and erasing the internal functions in the file)
27, , 
28, , TODO - I think it would be good to write code/unit tests for these things to check my answers.

31, Done, TODO - Study Drills wants me to add to this game. I could start doing something that was more Family History related here if I wanted to. 
32, Done, 
33, Done, The different Study Drills have sd# in their filename.
34, Done, TODO - This is about learning to reference list items with index 0. It could be good for practicing unit testing as well.
35, Done, 
36, Created, TODO - This is about writing my own version of the game. I think study drills for exercise 31 becomes a moot point after this. Possible topics: Family History, Missionary Work, Being Nice to Others. Of course those ideas are not exciting enough for my boys. They have created a couple of designs that will be the focus of what I'm doing.
37, , Code reading practice
38, Done, this was working with lists
39, Started, working with dictionaries, or dict

41, Done, TODO this is one I should continue to play with (it is called oop_test.py)
42, Done, 
43, Read, TODO this is his game. I started this, but decided to move on to Carson and Davis' games rather than code up his. 
44, Read, I read this, but decided not to code any of his examples up.
